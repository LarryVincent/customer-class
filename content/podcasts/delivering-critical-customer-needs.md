## Overview

Acquisition and retention dominate discussions about customer marketing. Yet, the bridge between the two is built upon a keen understanding of how to serve a customer's critical needs, especially unmet or under-served needs. Great customer marketers take this pursuit to an even higher level by aiming to deliver against a social mission.

Mahmee Co-Founder and CEO Melissa Hanna shares insights on how to achieve both. [Mahmee](https://mahmee.com) is improving prenatal and postparum care, with a deep focus on under-represented populations. Its promising business model has attracted high praise from the healthcare community, favorable media attention, and strong investor support. In this episode, Hanna provides perspective on the KPIs that allow her and her team to stay focused on the needs of *all* the stakeholders who participate in the process, while saving lives and improving the state of maternal care in the US.
