Kevin Hartman is a devoted and artistic practitioner of data. He believes data must do more than simply supply insights that motivate creative thought. Rather, data must express insights in ways that are just as creative as the ideas they inspire.

As Director Of Analytics for Google's Consumer, Government & Entertainment sector, Kevin and his team partner with major advertisers, creative agencies, and media companies to develop digital solutions that build businesses and brands. His approach mixes science and art to deliver inventive, fact-based strategies that reduce uncertainty and increase effectiveness in the marketing and advertising programs they create.
