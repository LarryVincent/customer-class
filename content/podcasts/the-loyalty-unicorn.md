## Overview

It is one of the most basic tenets of marketing management: keep your customers. For decades, study after study has demonstrated that it costs more to find new customers than it does to retain your existing customers. That's why it not surprising that most successful companies invest a lot of their resources on customer retention. 

But customer loyalty has also become the source of much debate. Always-on technology and the widespread adoption of the internet, wireless connectivity, and smart phones has made it easier than ever for customers to comparison shop and switch brands on a whim. Added to this challenge are new generations of customers who many marketers argue are less inclined to being brand loyal.

Is customer loyalty still achievable?

To answer this question, we interview Sandeep Dube of [Delta Airlines](https://www.delta.com). As head of Delta's extremely successful SkyMiles loyalty program, he offers a rich perspective on how managers should think about loyalty and retention in modern marketing.
