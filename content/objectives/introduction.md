+++
Welcome to MKT512. Our first week is dedicated to onboarding. We will explore the structure of the course, learn about the tools to navigate it, and establish the guiding philosophy of the content. 

We have three learning objectives this week:

1. Demonstrate how customer marketing differs from broader marketing disciplines, such as consumer marketing
2. Learn how to use discovery-based inquiry to gather customer insights
3. Practice using critical course tools 

## How I teach the course

### This Site

I created this site to be an easy guide to the course. You will find each week's agenda, learning objectives, relevant content (videos, audio, reading), and information about upcoming assignments.

### Slack

Slack is our primary communication tool during the course. I sent each of you an invitation to join the course's Slack workspace. If you have not already done so, please accept that invite and get setup. I strongly encourage you to download the app for your mobile phone or tablet. It makes it very easy to stay connected to the course. 

I continuously monitor Slack. You can always reach me there. If you email me with a question, I will probably ask you to post it on Slack rather than respond in your email. Keep in mind that Slack also allows you to message me privately. 

I have setup several channels on Slack and will create new channels as the course progresses, if needed. Channels are a great way to organize conversations. Because the content doesn't disappear, it provides a running record (including file sharing) that you can use later to prepare for assignments and the final exam.

Before our first class, you should take some time to familiarize yourself with the app and the way that I have organized channels. You can also create your own private groups and channels to facilitate group projects and smaller case discussions. 


### Office Hours

My office hours are from 5-6pm on Mondays and 9-10am on Thursdays (PT). You can schedule time with me on [my booking page](https://larry-vincent-usc.youcanbook.me). I am happy to meet with you to discuss any topics relevant to the course, and I'm also happy to discuss your career path. I encourage every student to set at least one office hour appointment with me during the semester. You can even set that time with a couple of other classmates so that we can have a discussion as a small group (I suggest no more than three at a time). If you wish to meet with me but can't meet during my scheduled time, please reach out to me via Slack to find an alternate time. I do my best to accommodate these requests.

### Google Docs, Sheets and Drive

We will be doing a lot of collaborative work and _brainswarming_. I will explain more about this during the week. I will sometimes ask you to use Google Docs to facilitate these collaborative workstreams and share with me.  I also use Google Drive to receive files from you. Most students already use these Google tools, but if you do not you should contact the Marshall help desk for information on how to get setup.

### R and RStudio

This is a data-driven course. We will be working with several datasets to perform analyses that drive our discussions. I will be using R to demonstrate these approaches throughout the course.

R is a free, open-source environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is one of the leading tools used in business for data science. While it has a steeper learning curve than many other statistical platforms, it is powerful, flexible and supported by a massive community. The latter is perhaps the most compelling reason for students to learn R. There are so many pre-existing packages and resources available to help you develop insights, and the R community is one of the friendliest and most inclusive in the world of data science.

You will receive an email invite from me to join our class workspace on the R Studio Cloud platform. There are many benefits to this cloud instance. It makes it easier for you to share your work and all of the packages and datasets that will be required for the course are pre-loaded there. 

### Email Blasts

In addition to this site, I send out an all-class email most weeks. You should have already received the first of these with an overview of the course and what to expect. These emails contain important information about the coming week, including questions for you to consider before case discussions. If you have not received an email from me, please check your spam filters and add my email address to your address book. I use Mailchimp to send these emails out because it provides a better experience and makes it easier for me to track distribution.

### Videos

Zoom is not an ideal environment for lecture material. That's why I created a series of 7-10 minute videos that I will post throughout the semester. These usually focus on theoretical material or technical demonstrations to help you conduct your analyses. You are required to watch these videos as part of the course. Links to the video will be shared via Slack (and on this site).

### Podcast

I have created an original podcast specifically for this course. Each episode is about 15-20 minutes long. There are six episodes, in total. I will post links to the current episode on this site, on Slack and in the email blasts. This content is part of the course and you are required to listen to it, but I do my best to make it entertaining. Each episode features a guest who is a leading marketer. Their perspectives are relevant to our learning and to our exploration of key concepts during the course. You will be able to listen to the content on any browser, but I also publish the episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and Google Play. If you subscribe to it through one of those platforms, you will automatically know when a new episode is available.
