I send out a class poll each week during the semester. These polls provide me with valuable information that I use to assess our progress as a class. I also use the information I gather in polls to guide class discussions. Finally, polls often contain questions that offer students an opportunity to apply principles and techniques that I teach in the course. While I don't grade the poll results, your participation in polls contributes towards your final course grade.

Each week, I send out a unique link to the poll to all registered students. Generally, the links go out over to provide you with plenty of time to respond before Monday's class.

## The Pre-Semester Poll

Of all the polls that I send out during the semester, this one is perhaps the most important. It also takes a little longer to complete, so give yourself plenty of time (about 10 minutes). This poll is all about you. It features several questions about your background, your goals for taking the course, and your experience with some of the methods and tools that we will be using during the course.
