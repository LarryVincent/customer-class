Welcome to MKT512. Our first week is dedicated to onboarding. We will explore the structure of the course, learn about the tools to navigate it, and establish the guiding philosophy of the content. This site will provide you with everything you need to know each week.

We have four learning objectives this week:

1. Demonstrate how customer marketing differs from broader marketing disciplines, such as consumer marketing
2. Learn how to use discovery-based inquiry to gather customer insights
4. Distinguish how data drives customer marketing decisions
3. Create a visualization of relevant data

## How I teach the course

### This Site

I created this site to be an easy guide to each week of the course. You will find each week's agenda, learning objectives, relevant content (videos, audio, reading), and information about upcoming assignments. As a courtesy, I repost a lot of the content on Blackboard but this site will generally provide you with a better, more organized user experience.

### Blackboard

I use Blackboard to post content that cannot be posted publicly (i.e. slide presentations, datasets, etc.). I occasionally use it to gather materials from you, as well. Usually, when I post something to Blackboard I will let you know that new content has been posted, but it is a good practice to check in once a week.

### Slack

I use Slack to facilitate asynchronous conversations during the course. If you have not already done so, you should download the app and accept the invitation that I have sent to you to join our course workstream. I continuously monitor Slack. You can always reach me there. If you email me with questions, I will often ask you to post them on Slack rather than respond in your email (unless your question requires privacy). I have setup several channels on Slack and will create new channels as the course progresses. Channels are a great way to organize conversations. Before our first class, you should take some time to familiarize yourself with the app and the way I have organized channels. 

### Google Docs, Sheets and Drive

We will be doing a lot of collaborative work and brainswarming. I will explain more about this during the week. I use Google Docs and Google Sheets to facilitate these collaborative workstreams. I find most students are already using these tools, but if you do not already have them you should contact the Marshall help desk for information on how to establish an account.

While we will use Google Docs and Google Sheets to facilitae collaborative workstreams, I will also post content to Google Drive and use it to receive files from you. Anything that I on Google Drive will also be posted to Blackboard. I find Drive it easier to use and many of my students in the past preferred it.

### R and RStudio

This is a data-driven course. We will be working with several data sets to perform anlyses that drive our discussions. Officially, I am agnostic about the tools you use to perform the required analyses. However, I will be using R to demonstrate these approaches throughout the course. 

R is a free, open-source environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is one of the leading tools used in business for data science. While it has a steeper learning curve than many other statistical platforms, it is powerful, flexible and supported by a massive community. The latter is perhaps the most compelling reason for students to learn R. There are so many pre-existing packages and resources available to help you develop insights, and the R community is one of the friendliest and most inclusive in the world of data science. 

You can [download R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) from its source or contact Marshall Research Computing. I also recommend that you [download R Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), a free development environment that makes learning and use R much easier. Note: you only need the free version. Do not purchase 

### Email Blasts

In addition to this site, I send out an all-class email most weeks. You should have already received the first of these with an overview of the course and what to expect. These emails contain important information about the coming week, including questions for you to consider before case discussions. If you have not received an email from me, please check your spam filters and add my email address to your address book. I use Mailchimp to send these emails out because it provides a better experience and makes it easier for me to track distribution.

### Videos

Because it is not possible for us to all meet in-person each session, I will be posting many of the lectures as 7-10 minute videos. You are required to watch these videos as part of the course. If any video content is optional, I will explicitly mark it. I usually upload these videos to Vimeo for the best video and audio quality. The videos are password protected. I will provide you with the password each week in my all-class email.

### Podcast

I have created an original podcast specifically for this course. Each episode is about 12-15 minutes long. There are six episodes, in total. I will post links to the current episode on this site, on Blackboard and in the email blasts. This content is part of the course and you are required to listen to it, but I do my best to make it entertaining. Each episode features a guest who is a leading marketer. Their perspectives are relevant to our learning and to our exploration of key concepts during the course. You will be able to listen to the content on any browser, but I also publish the episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, and Google Play. If you subscribe to it through one of those platforms, you will automatically know when a new episode is available.
