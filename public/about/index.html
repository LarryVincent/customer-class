				<p>Laurence Vincent is the Chief Branding Officer of <a href="http://unitedtalent.com">United Talent Agency</a>. An award-winning writer and veteran brand strategist, he has developed strategies for many leading brands, including Disney, Mattel, Microsoft, the NFL, Nikon, Sony Playstation, and WebMD. In his role at UTA he has harnessed that experience to help celebrity clients launch exciting new brands, such as <a href="http://bornandbred.com">Born and Bred</a> vodka for Channing Tatum, <a href="http://join-eby.com">EBY</a> for Sofia Vergara, and <a href="http://houseplant.com">Houseplant</a> for Seth Rogen.</p>
<p>Driven by the mantra that “story is strategy,” Vincent has pioneered narrative approaches to brand-building that combine insights from consumer research with best practices in storytelling and visual design.</p>
<p>Larry is an Adjunct Professor of Marketing at the <a href="http://marshall.usc.edu">USC Marshall School of Business</a>. Teaching is a true passion, as is his connection to the Trojan family. He earned his Bachelor of Arts at the USC School of Theatre, and his MBA at Marshall.</p>
<p>He has published three books. His most recent, <a href="http://brandrealbook.com"><em>Brand Real</em></a>, was selected by <em>strategy+business</em> magazine as one of the best business books of 2012. His first book on branding, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legendary-Brands-Unleashing-Storytelling-Strategy/dp/0793155606"><em>Legendary Brands</em></a>, was translated into seven languages and continues to serve as an important work that details the link between narrative and brand value. He is the editor and producer of <a href="http://findingsreport.com" title="The Findings Report"><em>The Findings Report</em></a>, a popular podcast and series of essays on why people buy, like and share. He has also written articles for <em>European Business Review</em> and <em>Forbes</em>. He is a frequent speaker on brands, consumer behavior, leadership, and marketing innovation.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;s not building brands, teaching, writing or podcasting, Larry enjoys life in Santa Monica, California. His family life and life as a storyteller converged in 2004 when his daughter was diagnosed with brain cancer. He has written extensively about her experiences on <a href="http://jordansjourney.com">Jordan&rsquo;s Journey</a>, a blog that chronicles the will and perseverance of his <em>cancer slayer</em>. That experience has also made him a dedicated advocate for childhood cancer fighters, and a proud board member of <a href="http://alexslemonade.org">Alex&rsquo;s Lemonade Stand Foundation</a>.</p>
